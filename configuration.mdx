# Morphik Configuration Guide

Morphik's behavior can be fully customized through the `databridge.toml` configuration file. This file is the central place to configure all aspects of the system, from API settings to model providers, database connections, and processing options.

## Configuration Basics

The `databridge.toml` file uses the TOML format (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language) to organize settings into logical sections. Each section controls a specific component of the Morphik system:

```toml
[section_name]
setting1 = "value1"
setting2 = 123
```

When you first set up Morphik, you can:
- Run `python quick_setup.py` for an interactive setup process
- Copy and modify the example `databridge.toml` file
- Create your own configuration file manually

## Registered Models Approach

Morphik uses a registered models approach which allows you to define hundreds of different models and reference them throughout your configuration. This makes it easy to:

- Use different models for different tasks
- Mix and match models based on your needs (e.g. smaller models for simpler tasks)
- Configure model-specific settings in one place
- Switch between providers without changing the rest of your configuration

### Defining Registered Models

First, register your models in the `[registered_models]` section:

```toml
[registered_models]
# OpenAI models
openai_gpt4o = { model_name = "gpt-4o" }
openai_gpt4 = { model_name = "gpt-4" }

# Azure OpenAI models
azure_gpt4 = { model_name = "gpt-4", api_base = "YOUR_AZURE_URL_HERE", api_version = "2023-05-15", deployment_id = "gpt-4-deployment" }
azure_gpt35 = { model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo", api_base = "YOUR_AZURE_URL_HERE", api_version = "2023-05-15", deployment_id = "gpt-35-turbo-deployment" }

# Anthropic models
claude_opus = { model_name = "claude-3-opus-20240229" }
claude_sonnet = { model_name = "claude-3-sonnet-20240229" }

# Ollama models
ollama_llama = { model_name = "ollama_chat/llama3.2", api_base = "http://localhost:11434" }
ollama_llama_docker = { model_name = "ollama_chat/llama3.2", api_base = "http://ollama:11434" }
ollama_llama_vision = { model_name = "ollama_chat/llama3.2-vision", api_base = "http://localhost:11434", vision = true }

# Embedding models
openai_embedding = { model_name = "text-embedding-3-small" }
openai_embedding_large = { model_name = "text-embedding-3-large" }
azure_embedding = { model_name = "text-embedding-ada-002", api_base = "YOUR_AZURE_URL_HERE", api_version = "2023-05-15", deployment_id = "embedding-ada-002" }
ollama_embedding = { model_name = "ollama/nomic-embed-text", api_base = "http://localhost:11434" }
```

### Using Registered Models

Then reference these models by their key in different sections:

```toml
[completion]
model = "ollama_llama"  # Reference to a key in registered_models
default_max_tokens = "1000"
default_temperature = 0.5

[embedding]
model = "ollama_embedding"  # Reference to registered model
dimensions = 768
similarity_metric = "cosine"

[parser.vision]
model = "ollama_llama_vision"  # Reference to a key in registered_models

[rules]
model = "ollama_llama"

[graph]
model = "ollama_llama"
```

This approach gives you maximum flexibility to use different models for different components, and even switch between local and cloud models as needed.

## Core Configuration Sections

### API Server Settings

Controls how the API server runs:

```toml
[api]
host = "localhost"  # Use "0.0.0.0" for Docker
port = 8000
reload = true       # Hot reload for development
```

### Authentication

Controls user authentication and permissions:

```toml
[auth]
jwt_algorithm = "HS256"
dev_mode = true  # Enables simplified auth for local development
dev_entity_id = "dev_user"
dev_entity_type = "developer"
dev_permissions = ["read", "write", "admin"]
```

### LLM Completion Settings

Configure the model used for generating text:

```toml
[completion]
model = "claude_sonnet"  # Reference to a key in registered_models
default_max_tokens = "1000"
default_temperature = 0.5
```

### Database Connection

Choose your document metadata database:

```toml
[database]
provider = "postgres"

# Or for MongoDB
[database]
provider = "mongodb"
database_name = "databridge"
collection_name = "documents"
```

### Embedding Configuration

Configure vector embeddings generation:

```toml
[embedding]
model = "openai_embedding"  # Reference to registered model
dimensions = 1536
similarity_metric = "cosine"
```

### Document Parsing

Control how documents are processed and chunked:

```toml
[parser]
chunk_size = 1000        # Characters per chunk
chunk_overlap = 200      # Overlap between chunks
use_unstructured_api = false
use_contextual_chunking = false
contextual_chunking_model = "ollama_llama"  # Reference to a key in registered_models
```

### Vision Processing

Configure multimodal processing for images and videos:

```toml
[parser.vision]
model = "ollama_llama_vision"  # Reference to a key in registered_models
frame_sample_rate = -1   # Set to -1 to disable frame captioning
```

### Reranking

Configure the cross-encoder reranker for improved retrieval:

```toml
# Enable reranking
[reranker]
use_reranker = true
provider = "flag"
model_name = "BAAI/bge-reranker-large"
query_max_length = 256
passage_max_length = 512
use_fp16 = true
device = "mps"  # "cpu", "cuda", or "mps"

# Disable reranking
[reranker]
use_reranker = false
```

### Document Storage

Choose where to store your document files:

```toml
# Local storage
[storage]
provider = "local"
storage_path = "./storage"

# AWS S3 storage
[storage]
provider = "aws-s3"
region = "us-east-2"
bucket_name = "databridge-storage"
```

### Vector Database

Configure where vector embeddings are stored:

```toml
# PostgreSQL with pgvector
[vector_store]
provider = "pgvector"

# MongoDB Atlas
[vector_store]
provider = "mongodb"
database_name = "databridge"
collection_name = "document_chunks"
```

### Rules Engine

Configure document processing with rules:

```toml
[rules]
model = "openai_gpt4"  # Reference to a key in registered_models
batch_size = 4096
```

### Knowledge Graph

Configure entity extraction and graph building:

```toml
[graph]
model = "claude_sonnet"  # Reference to a key in registered_models
enable_entity_resolution = true
```

### General DataBridge Settings

Control core platform features:

```toml
[databridge]
enable_colpali = true    # Enable advanced retrieval
mode = "self_hosted"     # "cloud" or "self_hosted"
```

### Telemetry

Configure observability settings:

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = true
honeycomb_enabled = true
honeycomb_endpoint = "https://api.honeycomb.io"
honeycomb_proxy_endpoint = "https://otel-proxy.onrender.com"
service_name = "databridge-core"
otlp_timeout = 10
otlp_max_retries = 3
otlp_retry_delay = 1
otlp_max_export_batch_size = 512
otlp_schedule_delay_millis = 5000
otlp_max_queue_size = 2048
```

## Environment Variables

Morphik uses environment variables for sensitive credentials and configuration that shouldn't be stored in the configuration file:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Secret for authentication tokens
- `POSTGRES_URI`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: For S3 storage
- `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`: For video transcription
- `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`: For enhanced document parsing (optional)
- `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`: For telemetry (optional)

## Mixing and Matching Models

With the registered models approach, you can easily optimize your configuration:

- Use powerful models like Claude Opus for knowledge graph generation
- Use smaller, faster models for simple parsing tasks
- Use OpenAI models for some tasks and Anthropic models for others
- Use Ollama for local development and cloud models for production

For example:

```toml
[parser.vision]
model = "openai_gpt4o"  # Use GPT-4o for image analysis

[rules]
model = "claude_sonnet"  # Use Claude Sonnet for rules processing

[completion]
model = "ollama_llama"  # Use Llama local model for general completion
```

## Docker Configuration Adjustments

When using Docker, make these changes:

1. Set `host = "0.0.0.0"` in the `[api]` section
2. For Ollama integration, use models with api_base set to `"http://ollama:11434"`
3. Use container names in your database connection strings

For more details on Docker deployment, check out the `DOCKER.md` file in the repository.
