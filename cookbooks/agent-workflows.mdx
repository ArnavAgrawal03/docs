---
The Morphik Agent enables sophisticated workflows that go far beyond simple document retrieval. This cookbook provides practical examples of how to use the agent for complex analysis tasks.

## Financial Analysis Workflow

This example shows how the agent can autonomously analyze financial documents, perform calculations, and generate insights.

```python
from morphik import Morphik

db = Morphik()

# Complex financial analysis query
result = db.agent_query("""
Analyze our quarterly financial reports for the last two years.
Calculate key metrics like revenue growth rate, profit margins, and ROI.
Identify trends and provide actionable recommendations for improving profitability.
Save the key insights for future reference.
""")

print("Financial Analysis:")
print(result["response"])

# Check what the agent did
print("\nAgent Tool Usage:")
for i, tool in enumerate(result["tool_history"], 1):
    print(f"{i}. {tool['tool_name']}")
    if tool['tool_name'] == 'execute_code':
        print(f"   Executed: {tool['tool_args']['code'][:100]}...")

# Display structured results
for obj in result["display_objects"]:
    if obj["type"] == "text" and "## Key Metrics" in obj["content"]:
        print("\nKey Financial Metrics:")
        print(obj["content"])
```

## Customer Research Pipeline

Demonstrates how the agent can research customer data, analyze sentiment, and identify opportunities.

```python
# Multi-step customer analysis
customer_analysis = db.agent_query("""
Research our customer feedback and support tickets from the last quarter.
Analyze sentiment trends and identify the top 3 pain points.
For each pain point, suggest specific product improvements.
Create a priority matrix based on impact and effort.
""")

print("Customer Research Results:")
print(customer_analysis["response"])

# Extract any charts or visualizations the agent created
for obj in customer_analysis["display_objects"]:
    if obj["type"] == "image":
        print(f"Generated visualization: {obj['caption']}")
        # In a real app, you'd display the image from obj["content"]
```

## Knowledge Graph Discovery

Shows how to use the agent to explore complex relationships in your data.

```python
# Knowledge graph exploration
kg_insights = db.agent_query("""
Explore our product knowledge graph to find unexpected connections 
between customer segments and product features.
Identify potential cross-selling opportunities based on relationship strengths.
Create a ranked list of opportunities with supporting evidence.
""")

print("Knowledge Graph Insights:")
print(kg_insights["response"])

# Check if the agent found any graph relationships
for tool in kg_insights["tool_history"]:
    if tool["tool_name"] == "knowledge_graph_query":
        print(f"Graph query: {tool['tool_args']}")
        print(f"Results: {str(tool['tool_result'])[:200]}...")
```

## Document Intelligence Workflow

Demonstrates automated document analysis and summarization.

```python
# Intelligent document processing
doc_intelligence = db.agent_query("""
Analyze all documents in our legal department folder.
Extract key contract terms, identify renewal dates, and flag any risks.
Create a summary report with actionable items for the legal team.
""")

print("Document Intelligence Report:")
print(doc_intelligence["response"])

# Show how the agent processed different document types
documents_analyzed = [
    tool for tool in doc_intelligence["tool_history"] 
    if tool["tool_name"] == "document_analyzer"
]

print(f"\nAnalyzed {len(documents_analyzed)} documents:")
for tool in documents_analyzed:
    doc_id = tool["tool_args"].get("document_id", "unknown")
    analysis_type = tool["tool_args"].get("analysis_type", "general")
    print(f"- Document {doc_id}: {analysis_type} analysis")
```

## Competitive Analysis

Shows how the agent can combine multiple data sources for strategic insights.

```python
# Strategic competitive analysis
competitive_analysis = db.agent_query("""
Analyze our product documentation and market research reports.
Compare our features against competitor data in the knowledge graph.
Identify gaps in our offering and opportunities for differentiation.
Calculate market share implications and recommend strategic priorities.
""")

print("Competitive Analysis:")
print(competitive_analysis["response"])

# Extract strategic recommendations
for obj in competitive_analysis["display_objects"]:
    if "recommendation" in obj["content"].lower():
        print("\nStrategic Recommendations:")
        print(obj["content"])
```

## Iterative Analysis with Memory

Demonstrates how the agent's memory enables progressive analysis.

```python
# Step 1: Initial analysis with memory
step1 = db.agent_query("""
Analyze our marketing campaign performance across all channels.
Calculate ROI for each channel and identify top performers.
Save the key findings and metrics for future analysis.
""")

# Step 2: Build on previous analysis
step2 = db.agent_query("""
Based on our previous marketing performance analysis,
develop an optimized budget allocation strategy for next quarter.
Compare projected ROI with current performance.
""")

# Step 3: Create action plan
step3 = db.agent_query("""
Using our marketing analysis and budget optimization,
create a detailed implementation plan with timelines and success metrics.
""")

print("Progressive Analysis Results:")
print("Step 1 - Performance Analysis:")
print(step1["response"][:200] + "...\n")

print("Step 2 - Budget Optimization:")
print(step2["response"][:200] + "...\n")

print("Step 3 - Implementation Plan:")
print(step3["response"])
```

## Data Validation and Quality Checks

Shows how the agent can validate data consistency across documents.

```python
# Data validation workflow
validation_results = db.agent_query("""
Check consistency of financial data across our quarterly reports.
Identify any discrepancies in revenue, costs, or key metrics.
Calculate data quality scores and flag potential errors.
Provide recommendations for improving data accuracy.
""")

print("Data Validation Results:")
print(validation_results["response"])

# Check for any code the agent wrote to validate data
code_executions = [
    tool for tool in validation_results["tool_history"]
    if tool["tool_name"] == "execute_code"
]

print(f"\nAgent performed {len(code_executions)} validation calculations")
for execution in code_executions:
    if "discrepancy" in str(execution["tool_result"]).lower():
        print("Found data discrepancy:", execution["tool_result"])
```

## Best Practices for Agent Workflows

### 1. Be Specific About Deliverables

```python
# Good: Clear expected outcomes
query = """
Analyze customer churn data and:
1. Calculate monthly churn rate trends
2. Identify top 3 churn drivers
3. Estimate revenue impact
4. Recommend retention strategies
"""

# Less optimal: Vague request
query = "Look at customer churn"
```

### 2. Use Memory for Complex Projects

```python
# Break complex projects into phases
phases = [
    "Analyze current market position and save findings",
    "Based on market analysis, identify expansion opportunities",
    "Create detailed business plan for top opportunity",
    "Calculate financial projections and risk assessment"
]

results = []
for phase in phases:
    result = db.agent_query(phase)
    results.append(result)
    print(f"Completed: {phase}")
```

### 3. Validate Agent Outputs

```python
def validate_agent_response(result):
    """Validate and extract key information from agent response"""
    
    # Check for errors
    if "error" in result["response"].lower():
        return {"valid": False, "error": "Agent reported error"}
    
    # Check if calculations were performed
    calculations = [
        tool for tool in result["tool_history"]
        if tool["tool_name"] == "execute_code"
    ]
    
    # Extract key metrics
    metrics = {}
    for obj in result["display_objects"]:
        if obj["type"] == "text" and "%" in obj["content"]:
            # Extract percentage values
            import re
            percentages = re.findall(r'(\d+\.?\d*)%', obj["content"])
            metrics["percentages"] = percentages
    
    return {
        "valid": True,
        "calculations_performed": len(calculations),
        "metrics": metrics,
        "sources_count": len(result["sources"])
    }

# Use validation
result = db.agent_query("Calculate our quarterly growth rate")
validation = validate_agent_response(result)
print(f"Validation: {validation}")
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

```python
def robust_agent_query(query, max_retries=2):
    """Agent query with error handling and retries"""
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        try:
            result = db.agent_query(query)
            
            # Check for tool failures
            failed_tools = [
                tool for tool in result.get("tool_history", [])
                if "error" in str(tool.get("tool_result", "")).lower()
            ]
            
            if failed_tools and attempt < max_retries:
                print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} had tool failures, retrying...")
                continue
                
            return result
            
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries:
                print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}, retrying...")
                continue
            else:
                raise e
    
    return None

# Use robust querying
result = robust_agent_query(
    "Perform complex financial analysis with error checking"
)
```

These workflows demonstrate the power of the Morphik Agent for complex, multi-step analysis tasks that would be impossible with traditional retrieval-based systems. The agent's ability to plan, execute tools, and remember context makes it ideal for sophisticated business intelligence and research workflows.
