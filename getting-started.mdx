# Direct Installation

## Prerequisites

<Accordion title="Python">
Please ensure that you have Python 3.12 installed on your machine. Guides for installing Python can be found on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3129/). 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PostgreSQL">
Morphik requires PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension for vector storage and similarity search capabilities. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    On macOS, you can use Homebrew to install PostgreSQL and pgvector:
    
    ```bash
    brew install postgresql@14
    brew install pgvector
    ```
    
    Start the PostgreSQL service:
    
    ```bash
    brew services start postgresql@14
    ```
    
    Create a database and user for DataBridge:
    
    ```bash
    createdb databridge
    createuser -s postgres
    ```
    
    These commands create a database named "databridge" and a superuser named "postgres" that the application will use to connect.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Ubuntu/Debian">
    Install PostgreSQL from the official repositories:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
    ```
    
    Install pgvector by building from source:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git
    cd pgvector
    make
    sudo make install
    ```
    
    Start and enable the PostgreSQL service:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start postgresql
    sudo systemctl enable postgresql
    ```
    
    Create a database and user for DataBridge:
    
    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres createdb databridge
    sudo -u postgres createuser -s postgres
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    1. Download and install PostgreSQL from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
    
    2. During installation, make note of the password you set for the postgres user.
    
    3. Install pgvector:
       - Open pgAdmin (installed with PostgreSQL)
       - Connect to your PostgreSQL server
       - Right-click on "Extensions" and select "Create > Extension"
       - Select "pgvector" from the dropdown and click "Save"
    
    4. Create a database for DataBridge:
       - Right-click on "Databases" and select "Create > Database"
       - Name it "databridge" and click "Save"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After installation, verify that Ollama is running correctly by making a simple query:


After installation, verify that PostgreSQL is running correctly:

```bash
psql -U postgres -c "SELECT version();"
```

You should see the following output:

```
 version                                                            
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Your postgres version and some compilation details>
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Additional Dependencies">
Some system-level dependencies might be required for processing various document types:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```bash
    # Install via Homebrew
    brew install poppler tesseract libmagic
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Ubuntu/Debian">
    ```bash
    # Install via apt
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils tesseract-ocr libmagic-dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    For Windows, you may need to install these dependencies manually:
    
    1. **Poppler**: Download from [poppler for Windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/)
    2. **Tesseract**: Download the installer from [UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
    3. **libmagic**: This is included in the python-magic-bin package which will be installed with pip
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You may also need additional Python packages or NLTK resources:

```bash
# If using Python 3.12+, you might need a specific version of unstructured
pip install unstructured==0.16.10

# Download required NLTK resources
python -m nltk.downloader averaged_perceptron_tagger punkt
```

If you encounter database initialization issues, you may need to manually initialize the schema:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d databridge -a -f init.sql
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Installing Ollama">

  <Tab title="macOS">
    Install Ollama using Homebrew:
    
    ```bash

    ```
    
    Start Ollama:
    
    ```bash
    ollama serve
    ```
    
    Pull a model to use with Morphik (in a new terminal):

       ollama pull llama3.2
       ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Accordion>

## Cloning the Repository

To get started with Morphik, we need to first setup the server. This involves cloning the [repository](https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core/), installing the dependencies, and the running the server. You are just a few steps away from accurate, agentic RAG over your multi-modal data!

First, let's clone the repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core.git
```

After cloning the repository, you will notice a `morphik-core` folder in your current directory.

```bash
ls morphik-core
```

If you see an error like `ls: morphik-core: No such file or directory`, it means that the repository is not cloned properly. Please try again.

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the `morphik-core` folder.

```bash
cd morphik-core
```

Next, you need to set up a virtual environment called `.venv`.

## Setting Up the Environment

### Installing Python Dependencies
<Note>
While it is not required, we highly recommend using a virtual environment to ensure dependencies from other projects do not conflict with Morphik. You may use managers like `uv` or `poetry`, but for this guide, we will use the built-in `venv` module.

Morphik currently supports Python 3.12 as the latest version. We recommend using Python 3.12 for optimal compatibility.
</Note>

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
```

Now, you need to activate the virtual environment. The activation command differs based on your operating system.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux/macOS">
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```    
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows (Command Prompt)">
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows (PowerShell)">
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

    If you encounter execution policy errors in PowerShell, you may need to run:

    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After activation, your command prompt should be prefixed with `(.venv)`, indicating that the virtual environment is active. Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting up the Server Parameters

At this point, you may want to customize the server - such as use a different embedding model, enable or disable certain features, etc. - you can do so by editing the `databridge.toml` file. You can find more details about configuration [here](/configuration). 

Morphik uses environment variables to manage secrets and api keys. In order to ensure that any pre-set keys are available to the server, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

In case you're using external models, you may have to edit the `.env` file with the necessary API keys. Finally, you can run the setup script to install dependencies and setup the database and vector store. 

```bash
python quick_setup.py
```

## Launching the Server

You are now ready to launch the Morphik server! Just run the following command to start the server.

```bash
python start_server.py
```

You should see the following output:

```
INFO:     Started server process [15169]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This means that the server is running on `http://localhost:8000`. You can now interact with the server using the API or the Python SDK.



## Next Steps

Now that you have the server running, you can explore the different ways to interact with the server.
