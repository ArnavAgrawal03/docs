That's it! You're ready to use Morphik now :)

## Using Morphik

While most users integrate Morphik into their applications via our SDKs and APIs, we also provide a comprehensive web interface that serves as both a playground and management console.

### Morphik Web Interface

The Morphik web interface provides a complete view of your application:

![Morphik Application Interface](/assets/app_interface.png)

In the web interface, you can:
- üìÑ **Browse and manage** all your documents and folders
- üí¨ **Use the Chat and Agent** for interactive queries and complex tasks
- üîó **Visualize Knowledge Graphs** to understand document relationships
- üìä **Monitor logs** and track API usage
- üí≥ **View billing and usage details** for your account
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configure settings** and manage your application

This interface is perfect for testing queries, debugging, and getting familiar with Morphik's capabilities before integrating it into your code.

### Using Morphik via Code

For production use, you'll want to integrate Morphik using our SDKs or API:

      # Initialize the Morphik client
      morphik = Morphik(uri="your-morphik-uri")
      # Ingest a file
      doc = morphik.ingest_file(file_path="super/complex/file.pdf")
      doc.wait_for_completion()

      # Query the file
      response = morphik.query(query="What percentage of Morphik users are building something cool?")
      print(response) # Responds with 100% :)
      ```

  <Tab title="Rest API">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Extract your bearer token">
      The bearer token can be extracted directly from your Morphik URI. The URI has the following format:
      
      `morphik://<app_name>:<bearer_token>@<host>`
      
      The middle part between the colon and the @ symbol is your bearer token.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make API requests">
      When making requests to the Morphik API, include your bearer token in the `Authorization` header:
      
      ```bash        
        curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.morphik.ai/documents?skip=0&limit=10000' \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_bearer_token>"
        -H 'accept: application/json' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{}'
