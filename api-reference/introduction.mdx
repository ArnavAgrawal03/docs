<Note>
If you're using Python, you can directly use the Morphik SDK to interact with the API. Installation instruction can be found on the [Python SDK](/python-sdk/introduction) tab.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have Python 3.12 installed on your machine. Guides for installing Python can be found on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3129/). 

## Installing and Running the Server

To get started with Morphik, we need to first setup the server. This involves cloning the [repository](https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core/), installing the dependencies, and the running the server. You are just a few steps away from accurate, agentic RAG over your multi-modal data!

First, let's clone the repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core.git
```

After cloning the repository, you will notice a `morphik-core` folder in your current directory.

```bash
ls morphik-core
```

If you see an error like `ls: morphik-core: No such file or directory`, it means that the repository is not cloned properly. Please try again.

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the `morphik-core` folder.

```bash
cd morphik-core
```

Next, you need to set up a virtual environment called `.venv`.

<Note>
While it is not required, we highly recommend using a virtual environment to ensure dependencies from other projects do not conflict with Morphik. You may use managers like `uv` or `poetry`, but for this guide, we will use the built-in `venv` module.
</Note>

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
```

Now, you need to activate the virtual environment. The activation command differs based on your operating system.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux/macOS">
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```    
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows (Command Prompt)">
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows (PowerShell)">
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

    If you encounter execution policy errors in PowerShell, you may need to run:

    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After activation, your command prompt should be prefixed with `(.venv)`, indicating that the virtual environment is active. Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now launch the Morphik server. In case you want to customize the server - such as use a different embedding model, enable or disable certain features, etc. - you can do so by editing the `morphik.toml` file. You can find more details about configuration [here](/api-reference/configuration).

Finally! We are now ready to run the server. Just run the following command to start the server.

```bash
python start_server.py
```

You should see the following output:

```
INFO:     Started server process [15169]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This means that the server is running on `http://localhost:8000`. You can now interact with the server using the API.
