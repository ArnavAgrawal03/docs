description: 'An overview of DataBridge'
---

DataBridge is a database that makes it easy to create fast, versatile, and production-ready AI apps and agents.

Key features include:

- **First class support for Unstructured Data**: Unlike traditional databases, DataBridge allows users to directly ingest unstructured data of all forms - including (but not limited to) videos and PDFs. We've built research-driven custom algorithms to ensure state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy. 
- **Persistent KV-caching**: For documents you reference often, you can process them once and *freeze* the LLM's internal state such that you can use it again later. This helps drastically reduce compute costs as well speed up model responses.
- **Out of the box MCP support**: DataBridge has [built in support](https://github.com/databridge-org/databridge-core/) for the open-source [Model Context Protocol](modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) - so you can integrate your knowledge with any MCP client in a single click.
- **Completely Open-source**: You can check out DataBridge core code [here!](https://github.com/databridge-org/databridge-core/).

## How does it work?

DataBridge is completely open-source under the [MIT license](https://github.com/databridge-org/databridge-core/blob/main/LICENSE). You can simply clone the [repo](https://github.com/databridge-org/databridge-core/) and get started with [our guide](/getting-started).

<Note>
In the future, we will offer a hosted, fully-managed version of DataBridge. If interested, you can sign up for the waitlist [here](https://forms.gle/jtxxSuv4KND3aMYS8). 
</Note>

DataBridge is built on the shoulders of some amazing open-source projects. We use a mixture of models and techniques, including knowledge graphs for GraphRAG, ColQwen for document and diagram search, PGVector and nomic for  */}
