## What is the Morphik Agent?

The Morphik Agent is an intelligent assistant that can autonomously use various tools to answer complex queries. Unlike the regular `query` method which retrieves and generates responses from existing documents, the agent can:

- **Plan and execute**: Decide which tools to use based on your query
- **Perform calculations**: Write and run Python code for analysis
- **Explore relationships**: Navigate knowledge graphs to find connections
- **Remember context**: Save insights for future queries
- **Generate rich content**: Provide structured responses with text and images

## When should I use `agent_query` vs `query`?

### Use `agent_query` when you need:

✅ **Multi-step analysis**
```python
# Agent can break this down into multiple steps automatically
result = db.agent_query("""
Analyze our customer data, calculate churn rates, 
identify key factors, and recommend retention strategies
""")
```

✅ **Calculations and data processing**
```python
# Agent will write and execute code to perform calculations
result = db.agent_query("""
Calculate the ROI for each marketing channel and 
rank them by effectiveness
""")
```

✅ **Knowledge graph exploration**
```python
# Agent can navigate complex relationships
result = db.agent_query("""
Find connections between our premium customers and 
specific product features to identify upsell opportunities
""")
```

✅ **Research requiring document discovery**
```python
# Agent will find relevant documents automatically
result = db.agent_query("""
Research our competitive position in the enterprise market
""")
```

### Use regular `query` when you need:

✅ **Quick fact-finding**
```python
# Simple retrieval-based question
response = db.query("What was our revenue last quarter?")
```

✅ **Direct document questions**
```python
# Straightforward Q&A about specific content
response = db.query("What are the main features of Product X?")
```

✅ **Performance-critical applications**
```python
# When speed is more important than analysis depth
response = db.query("Find documents about topic Y")
```

## How do I interpret agent responses?

The agent returns a rich dictionary with four components:

### 1. Main Response
```python
result = db.agent_query("Analyze sales trends")
print(result["response"])  # The agent's final answer
```

### 2. Tool History (understand what the agent did)
```python
for tool in result["tool_history"]:
    print(f"Tool: {tool['tool_name']}")
    print(f"Args: {tool['tool_args']}")
    print(f"Result: {tool['tool_result']}")
```

### 3. Display Objects (structured content)
```python
for obj in result["display_objects"]:
    if obj["type"] == "text":
        print("Text content:", obj["content"])
    elif obj["type"] == "image":
        print("Image caption:", obj["caption"])
        # obj["content"] contains the actual image data
```

### 4. Sources (attribution)
```python
for source in result["sources"]:
    print(f"Source: {source['documentName']}")
    print(f"ID: {source['sourceId']}")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be specific about your goals
```python
# Good: Clear, specific request
query = """
Analyze customer satisfaction surveys from Q3, 
calculate NPS scores by region, and identify 
the top 3 areas for improvement
"""

# Less optimal: Vague request
query = "Look at customer feedback"
```

### 2. Use memory for complex projects
```python
# Step 1: Analysis with memory
step1 = db.agent_query("""
Analyze our product performance metrics and 
save key insights for future reference
""")

# Step 2: Build on previous analysis  
step2 = db.agent_query("""
Based on our product performance analysis,
create a roadmap for improvements
""")
```

### 3. Validate important results
```python
result = db.agent_query("Calculate financial projections")

# Check if calculations were performed
calculations = [
    tool for tool in result["tool_history"] 
    if tool["tool_name"] == "execute_code"
]

if calculations:
    print(f"Agent performed {len(calculations)} calculations")
    # Review the code and results
    for calc in calculations:
        print("Code:", calc["tool_args"]["code"])
        print("Result:", calc["tool_result"])
```

## Common Use Cases

### Financial Analysis
```python
result = db.agent_query("""
Analyze our quarterly financial statements,
calculate key ratios (ROE, ROI, profit margins),
and compare against industry benchmarks
""")
```

### Customer Research
```python
result = db.agent_query("""
Research customer feedback across all channels,
identify sentiment trends, and prioritize
product improvements by impact
""")
```

### Competitive Intelligence
```python
result = db.agent_query("""
Compare our product features against competitors,
identify gaps in our offering, and recommend
strategic priorities for next quarter
""")
```

### Document Intelligence
```python
result = db.agent_query("""
Analyze all contracts in our legal folder,
extract key terms and renewal dates,
and flag any potential risks
""")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent is taking too long
- Break complex queries into smaller steps
- Be more specific about what you need
- Check if you're asking for too many calculations

### Results seem incomplete
- Check the `tool_history` to see what the agent tried
- Look for error messages in tool results
- Try rephrasing your query more clearly

### Want to see intermediate steps
```python
result = db.agent_query("Complex analysis task")

# Review each step the agent took
for i, tool in enumerate(result["tool_history"], 1):
    print(f"Step {i}: {tool['tool_name']}")
    print(f"Input: {tool['tool_args']}")
    print(f"Output: {str(tool['tool_result'])[:200]}...")
    print("-" * 50)
```

## Limitations

- **Response time**: Agent queries take longer than regular queries (10-60 seconds)
- **Usage limits**: Cloud deployments may have rate limits for agent calls
- **Context window**: Very complex queries might exceed the model's context window
- **Tool availability**: Some tools may not be available in all deployments

The Morphik Agent is designed for sophisticated analysis tasks that require planning, computation, and multi-step reasoning. For simple document retrieval, the regular `query` method will be faster and more cost-effective.
