Morphik makes it easy to expose your content through a conversational interface. A typical workflow is:

1. **Ingest** your documents using the Python SDK:

```python
from morphik import Morphik

client = Morphik()
client.ingest_text("docs/")
```

2. **Create a cache** so retrieval can be fast:

```python
client.create_cache(name="chatbot-cache", model="llama2", docs=["docs/"])
```

3. **Query the cache** within your chat application:

```python
results = client.cached_search("chatbot-cache", query="How do I get started?")
```

See the [create_cache](/python-sdk/create_cache) and [cached_search](/python-sdk/batch_get_documents) docs for more details on these API calls.

Once you retrieve relevant context, pass it to your favorite LLM to generate a response.
