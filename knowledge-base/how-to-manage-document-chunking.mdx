Choosing an effective chunking strategy balances context length with retrieval precision. Overly large chunks may dilute relevance, while tiny chunks can miss important context.

Morphik lets you control chunk sizes in your `morphik.toml` configuration. Tweak `parser.chunk_size` and `parser.chunk_overlap` to balance context and recall:

```toml
[parser]
chunk_size = 1000
chunk_overlap = 200
```

Re-ingest documents after updating these settings to apply the new rules.
