Choosing an effective chunking strategy balances context length with retrieval precision. Overly large chunks may dilute relevance, while tiny chunks can miss important context.

Morphik lets you control chunk sizes in your `morphik.toml` configuration. Tweak `parser.chunk_size` and `parser.chunk_overlap` to balance context and recall:

```toml
[parser]
chunk_size = 1000
chunk_overlap = 200
```

Re-ingest documents after updating these settings to apply the new rules.

### Related questions

- **Q:** What chunk size works best for large PDFs?  
  **A:** For large PDFs, a chunk size of 1000-2000 characters often works well, as it provides enough context while maintaining retrieval precision. However, the ideal size depends on your content and use case - technical documents might benefit from larger chunks, while conversational text might work better with smaller ones.

- **Q:** How does chunk overlap affect answer quality?  
  **A:** Chunk overlap (typically 10-20% of chunk size) helps maintain context between chunks and prevents important information from being split across chunk boundaries. This is particularly important for questions that might span multiple sections of a document.

- **Q:** Do I need to re-ingest data after changing chunk settings?  
  **A:** Yes, any changes to chunk size or overlap require re-ingesting your documents, as these settings determine how the text is processed and indexed. The system needs to recreate the document chunks with your new settings to ensure proper retrieval.
