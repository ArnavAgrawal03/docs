Modern applications often need to search across different data types like PDFs, images, and transcribed audio. Managing those sources separately can be cumbersome.

Morphik accepts multiple modalities out of the box, storing them in a unified index so you can search across all your data with one query. Simply ingest each item with `ingest_file` or `ingest_text`:

```python
from morphik import Morphik

db = Morphik()
db.ingest_file("diagram.png")
db.ingest_text("README.md")

results = db.retrieve_docs(query="project overview")
```
