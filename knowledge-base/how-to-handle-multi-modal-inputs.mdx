Modern applications often need to search across different data types like PDFs, images, and transcribed audio. Managing those sources separately can be cumbersome.

Morphik accepts multiple modalities out of the box, storing them in a unified index so that a single query can retrieve relevant text snippets, image regions, or other files without extra effort.

```python
from morphik import Morphik
client = Morphik()

client.ingest_text("docs/")
client.ingest_files(["screenshots/img1.png", "audio/intro.wav"])
results = client.search("show me the intro")
```

Mixing modalities enables more powerful answers across all your data sources.
