Effective document search relies on representing your data in a way that captures meaning. Common approaches include keyword search, vector similarity search, and semantic graph traversal. 

With Morphik, you can ingest text, images, and other modalities. Use the `retrieve_docs` function for a simple vector similarity search or `query` to combine retrieval with language model generation:

```python
from morphik import Morphik

db = Morphik()

# Retrieve top matching documents
docs = db.retrieve_docs(query="latest sales figures", k=3)

# Or generate an answer from the documents
answer = db.query("summarize the trends", k=3)
print(answer.text)
```
