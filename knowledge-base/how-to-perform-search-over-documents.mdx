Effective document search relies on representing your data in a way that captures meaning. Common approaches include keyword search, vector similarity search, and semantic graph traversal. 

With Morphik, you can ingest text, images, and other modalities, then leverage its built-in vector search and knowledge graph capabilities to quickly find the most relevant information.

Example search using the Python SDK:

```python
from morphik import Morphik

client = Morphik()
client.ingest_text("docs/")
results = client.search("How do payments work?", filters={"product": "billing"})
```

You can also use [batch_get_documents](/python-sdk/batch_get_documents) to retrieve multiple results at once.
