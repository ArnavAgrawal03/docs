Quality retrieval depends on thoughtful preprocessing and query handling. Consider:

- Chunking documents into meaningful sections.
- Choosing the right embedding model for your domain.
- Applying metadata filters or reranking to refine results.

Morphik supports custom chunk sizes, multiple embedding models, and powerful filtering so you can tune retrieval to your needs. For example:

```python
from morphik import Morphik

db = Morphik()

# Query with filters and reranking
docs = db.query(
    "renewable energy projects",
    filters={"category": "energy"},
    k=8,
    use_reranking=True,
)
```
