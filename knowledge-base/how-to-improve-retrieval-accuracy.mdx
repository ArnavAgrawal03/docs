Quality retrieval depends on thoughtful preprocessing and query handling. Consider:

- Chunking documents into meaningful sections.
- Choosing the right embedding model for your domain.
- Applying metadata filters or reranking to refine results.

Morphik supports custom chunk sizes, multiple embedding models, and powerful filtering so you can tune retrieval to your needs.

Here is a snippet demonstrating custom chunking and filtering:

```python
from morphik import Morphik
client = Morphik()

client.ingest_text("docs/", chunk_size=500)
client.create_cache(name="filtered-cache", filters={"lang": "en"})
results = client.cached_search("filtered-cache", query="setup guide")
```
