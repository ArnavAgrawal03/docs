After building a knowledge graph, you may want to inspect how documents connect. Use the Python SDK to export graph data for visualization:

```python
from morphik import Morphik

client = Morphik()
graph = client.create_graph(name="docs-graph")

edges = client.get_graph_edges(graph.id)
```

The `edges` variable will contain source and destination node IDs. You can feed this into libraries like `networkx` or visualize directly in a notebook. See [create_graph](/python-sdk/create_graph) and [get_graph_edges](/python-sdk/get_graph) for more info.
