Over time you may need to remove outdated files or replace them with new versions. Use the Python SDK's deletion helpers:

```python
from morphik import Morphik
client = Morphik()

client.delete_document_by_filename("manual-v1.pdf")
```

After deleting, consider re-ingesting updated documents. You can automate this process in your deployment pipeline. See [delete_document_by_filename](/python-sdk/delete_document_by_filename) for more options.
