## Graph Properties

Each `Graph` object in the returned list has the following properties:

- `id` (str): Unique graph identifier
- `name` (str): Graph name
- `entities` (List[Entity]): List of entities in the graph
- `relationships` (List[Relationship]): List of relationships in the graph
- `metadata` (Dict[str, Any]): Graph metadata
- `document_ids` (List[str]): Source document IDs
- `filters` (Dict[str, Any], optional): Document filters used to create the graph
- `created_at` (datetime): Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (datetime):  Last update timestamp
- `owner` (Dict[str, str]): Graph owner information
