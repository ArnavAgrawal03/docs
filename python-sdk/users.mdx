## Overview

User scoping in Morphik allows multi-tenant applications to isolate data on a per-user basis. This ensures that in applications serving multiple users, each user can only access their own documents and data. User scoping is particularly valuable for building customer-facing applications where data privacy and separation are essential.

## Creating User Scopes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    from morphik import Morphik
    
    db = Morphik()
    
    # Create a user scope for a specific end user
    user_scope = db.signin("customer_12345")
    
    # All operations from this scope are now isolated to this user
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    from morphik import AsyncMorphik
    
    async with AsyncMorphik() as db:
        # Create a user scope for a specific end user
        user_scope = db.signin("customer_12345")
        
        # All operations from this scope are now isolated to this user
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Operations Within a User Scope

Once you have a user scope, all operations performed on it are automatically scoped to that specific user. Documents created or retrieved are only accessible to that user.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    # Get a user scope
    user_scope = db.signin("customer_12345")
    
    # Ingest a document for this user
    doc = user_scope.ingest_text("My private notes", 
                               filename="notes.txt",
                               metadata={"type": "personal"})
    
    # List only this user's documents
    user_docs = user_scope.list_documents()
    
    # Search only within this user's documents
    results = user_scope.retrieve_chunks("notes")
    
    # Query using only this user's documents as context
    response = user_scope.query("What are my notes about?")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    # Get a user scope
    user_scope = db.signin("customer_12345")
    
    # Ingest a document for this user
    doc = await user_scope.ingest_text("My private notes", 
                                     filename="notes.txt",
                                     metadata={"type": "personal"})
    
    # List only this user's documents
    user_docs = await user_scope.list_documents()
    
    # Search only within this user's documents
    results = await user_scope.retrieve_chunks("notes")
    
    # Query using only this user's documents as context
    response = await user_scope.query("What are my notes about?")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## User Scope Methods

The UserScope class provides the same document operations as the main Morphik client, but automatically scoped to the specific user:

- `ingest_text` - Ingest text content for this user
- `ingest_file` - Ingest a file for this user
- `ingest_files` - Ingest multiple files for this user
- `ingest_directory` - Ingest all files from a directory for this user
- `retrieve_chunks` - Retrieve chunks matching a query from this user's documents
- `retrieve_docs` - Retrieve documents matching a query from this user's documents
- `query` - Generate a completion using context from this user's documents (supports `llm_config` parameter for custom LLM configuration)
- `list_documents` - List all documents owned by this user
- `batch_get_documents` - Get multiple documents by their IDs for this user
- `batch_get_chunks` - Get specific chunks by source for this user
- `create_graph` - Create a knowledge graph from this user's documents
- `update_graph` - Update a knowledge graph with new documents from this user
- `delete_document_by_filename` - Delete a document by filename for this user

## Using Custom LLM Configuration with User Scopes

You can pass a custom LLM configuration when querying within a user scope:

  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    from morphik import Morphik
    
    db = Morphik()
    user_scope = db.signin("user123")
    
    # Use a specific model for this user's query
    response = user_scope.query(
        "What documents have I uploaded recently?",
        llm_config={
            "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
            "temperature": 0.3,
            "max_tokens": 1000
        }
    )
    
    print(response.completion)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    from morphik import AsyncMorphik
    
    async with AsyncMorphik() as db:
        user_scope = db.signin("user123")
        
        # Use a specific model for this user's query
        response = await user_scope.query(
            "What documents have I uploaded recently?",
            llm_config={
                "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
                "temperature": 0.3,
                "max_tokens": 1000
            }
        )
        
        print(response.completion)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Example: Customer Support Application

A common use case for user scoping is in customer support applications where each customer has their own set of documents and needs personalized assistance:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    from morphik import Morphik
    
    db = Morphik("morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai")
    
    def process_customer_request(customer_id, query):
        # Sign in as the specific customer
        customer_scope = db.signin(customer_id)
        
        # List the customer's documents
        documents = customer_scope.list_documents()
        print(f"Customer {customer_id} has {len(documents)} documents")
        
        # Get personalized answer based only on this customer's documents
        response = customer_scope.query(
            query,
            filters={"type": "support_case"},
            temperature=0.3
        )
        
        return response.completion
    
    # Handle customer requests
    answer = process_customer_request(
        "customer_12345", 
        "What's the status of my recent support ticket?"
    )
    
    print(answer)  # Only includes information from this customer's documents
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    from morphik import AsyncMorphik
    
    async def process_customer_request(customer_id, query):
        async with AsyncMorphik("morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai") as db:
            # Sign in as the specific customer
            customer_scope = db.signin(customer_id)
            
            # List the customer's documents
            documents = await customer_scope.list_documents()
            print(f"Customer {customer_id} has {len(documents)} documents")
            
            # Get personalized answer based only on this customer's documents
            response = await customer_scope.query(
                query,
                filters={"type": "support_case"},
                temperature=0.3
            )
            
            return response.completion
    
    # Handle customer requests
    import asyncio
    
    async def main():
        answer = await process_customer_request(
            "customer_12345", 
            "What's the status of my recent support ticket?"
        )
        print(answer)  # Only includes information from this customer's documents
    
    # Run the async function
    asyncio.run(main())
    ```
  </Tab>

## Combining User Scope with Folder Scope

For advanced data organization, you can combine user scoping with folder scoping. This allows you to organize by both user and functional area:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    # First, create a folder
    support_folder = db.create_folder("support_cases")
    
    # Then, scope to a specific user within that folder
    user_support = support_folder.signin("customer_12345")
    
    # This document is accessible only to customer_12345 
    # and only within the support_cases folder
    doc = user_support.ingest_file("path/to/case_details.pdf")
    
    # Query is scoped to just this user's documents 
    # within the support_cases folder
    response = user_support.query("What's the status of my case?")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    # First, create a folder
    support_folder = db.create_folder("support_cases")
    
    # Then, scope to a specific user within that folder
    user_support = support_folder.signin("customer_12345")
    
    # This document is accessible only to customer_12345 
    # and only within the support_cases folder
    doc = await user_support.ingest_file("path/to/case_details.pdf")
    
    # Query is scoped to just this user's documents 
    # within the support_cases folder
    response = await user_support.query("What's the status of my case?")
    ```
  </Tab>

## Bulk Document Processing for Multiple Users
