    ```

## Parameters

- `document_id` (str): ID of the document to delete

## Returns

A dictionary containing information about the deletion operation:
- `message` (str): A success message indicating the document was deleted
- `document_id` (str): The ID of the deleted document
- Additional fields may be present with more details about the operation

## Description

This method deletes a document and all its associated data, including:
- Document metadata in the database
- Document content in storage
- Document chunks and embeddings in the vector store

This operation is permanent and cannot be undone.

## Finding Document IDs

If you don't know the document ID, you can use other methods to find it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    # List documents to find IDs
    docs = db.list_documents(limit=10)
    for doc in docs:
        print(f"ID: {doc.external_id}, Filename: {doc.filename}")
        
    # Or get document by filename
    doc = db.get_document_by_filename("report.pdf")
    document_id = doc.external_id
    
    # Then delete it
    result = db.delete_document(document_id)
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    # List documents to find IDs
    docs = await db.list_documents(limit=10)
    for doc in docs:
        print(f"ID: {doc.external_id}, Filename: {doc.filename}")
        
    # Or get document by filename
    doc = await db.get_document_by_filename("report.pdf")
    document_id = doc.external_id
    
    # Then delete it
    result = await db.delete_document(document_id)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Notes

- For convenience, you can also use the [delete_document_by_filename](/python-sdk/delete_document_by_filename) method if you know the filename but not the ID.
- This operation requires appropriate permissions for the document.
- Deleting a document that is part of an existing knowledge graph will not automatically update the graph. You may need to recreate or update the graph separately.
