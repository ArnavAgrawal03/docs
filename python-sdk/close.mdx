# close

Close the HTTP session.

```python
def close()
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

None

## Example

```python
from databridge.sync import DataBridge

db = DataBridge()

# Perform operations
doc = db.ingest_text("Sample content")

# Close the session when done
db.close()
```

## Context Manager Alternative

Instead of manually calling `close()`, you can use the DataBridge client as a context manager:

```python
from databridge.sync import DataBridge

with DataBridge() as db:
    doc = db.ingest_text("Sample content")
    # Session is automatically closed when exiting the with block
```
