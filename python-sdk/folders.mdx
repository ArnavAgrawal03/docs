## Overview

Folders in Morphik provide a way to organize documents into logical groups. This is particularly useful for multi-project environments where you want to maintain separation between different contexts. Documents within a folder are isolated from those in other folders, allowing for clean organization and data separation.  

> ℹ️ All folder APIs accept **either the folder’s UUID or its name**. Use whichever identifier you already have—Morphik resolves it automatically.

## Creating and Accessing Folders

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    from morphik import Morphik
    
    db = Morphik()
    
    # Create a new folder
    folder = db.create_folder("marketing_docs")
    
    # Access an existing folder by name or UUID
    folder = db.get_folder("marketing_docs")
    folder_by_id = db.get_folder(folder.id)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    from morphik import AsyncMorphik
    
    async with AsyncMorphik() as db:
        # Create a new folder
        folder = db.create_folder("marketing_docs")
        
        # Access an existing folder by name or UUID
        folder = await db.get_folder("marketing_docs")
        folder_by_id = await db.get_folder(folder.id)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Operations Within a Folder

Once you have a folder object, all operations performed on it are scoped to that folder. Documents created, retrieved, or manipulated will be contained within this folder's scope.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    # Get a folder
    folder = db.get_folder("marketing_docs")
    
    # Ingest a document into this folder
    doc = folder.ingest_text("New marketing strategy for Q3", 
                           filename="strategy_q3.txt",
                           metadata={"department": "marketing", "quarter": "Q3"})
    
    # Retrieve documents only from this folder
    marketing_docs = folder.list_documents()
    
    # Search documents only within this folder
    results = folder.retrieve_chunks("marketing strategy")
    
    # Query within the folder context
    response = folder.query("What is our Q3 marketing strategy?")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    # Get a folder
    folder = db.get_folder("marketing_docs")
    
    # Ingest a document into this folder
    doc = await folder.ingest_text("New marketing strategy for Q3", 
                                 filename="strategy_q3.txt",
                                 metadata={"department": "marketing", "quarter": "Q3"})
    
    # Retrieve documents only from this folder
    marketing_docs = await folder.list_documents()
    
    # Search documents only within this folder
    results = await folder.retrieve_chunks("marketing strategy")
    
    # Query within the folder context
    response = await folder.query("What is our Q3 marketing strategy?")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Folder Methods

All the core document operations available on the main Morphik client are also available on folder objects, but they are automatically scoped to the specific folder:

- `ingest_text` - Ingest text content into this folder
- `ingest_file` - Ingest a file into this folder
- `ingest_files` - Ingest multiple files into this folder
- `ingest_directory` - Ingest all files from a directory into this folder
- `retrieve_chunks` - Retrieve chunks matching a query from this folder
- `retrieve_docs` - Retrieve documents matching a query from this folder
- `query` - Generate a completion using context from this folder (supports `llm_config` parameter for custom LLM configuration)
- `list_documents` - List all documents in this folder
- `batch_get_documents` - Get multiple documents by their IDs from this folder
- `batch_get_chunks` - Get specific chunks by source from this folder
- `create_graph` - Create a knowledge graph from documents in this folder
- `update_graph` - Update a knowledge graph with new documents from this folder
- `delete_document_by_filename` - Delete a document by filename from this folder

## Managing Existing Documents and Folders

You can move previously ingested documents into a folder, remove them, or delete the entire folder. The SDK methods accept a folder name or UUID.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    from morphik import Morphik

    db = Morphik()
    folder = db.get_folder("marketing_docs")
    
    document_id = "doc_123"

    # Add an existing document to the folder (name or UUID works)
    db.add_document_to_folder(folder.id, document_id)
    db.add_document_to_folder("marketing_docs", document_id)

    # Remove the document from the folder
    db.remove_document_from_folder("marketing_docs", document_id)

    # Delete the folder (also removes its documents)
    db.delete_folder(folder.id)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    from morphik import AsyncMorphik

    async with AsyncMorphik() as db:
        folder = await db.get_folder("marketing_docs")
        document_id = "doc_123"

        await db.add_document_to_folder(folder.id, document_id)
        await db.add_document_to_folder("marketing_docs", document_id)

        await db.remove_document_from_folder("marketing_docs", document_id)

        await db.delete_folder(folder.id)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Custom LLM Configuration with Folders

You can pass a custom LLM configuration when querying within a folder:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    from morphik import Morphik
    
    db = Morphik()
    folder = db.get_folder("research")
    
    # Use a specific model for this query
    response = folder.query(
        "Summarize the latest findings",
        llm_config={
            "model": "claude-3-opus-20240229",
            "temperature": 0.5
        }
    )
    
    print(response.completion)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    from morphik import AsyncMorphik
    
    async with AsyncMorphik() as db:
        folder = db.get_folder("research")
        
        # Use a specific model for this query
        response = await folder.query(
            "Summarize the latest findings",
            llm_config={
                "model": "claude-3-opus-20240229",
                "temperature": 0.5
            }
        )
        
        print(response.completion)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Example: Project Document Management

A common use case for folders is separating different projects. Here's an example of how to organize project documentation:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    from morphik import Morphik
    from pathlib import Path
    
    db = Morphik()
    
    # Create folders for different projects
    project_a = db.create_folder("project_a")
    project_b = db.create_folder("project_b")
    
    # Ingest project documentation into respective folders
    project_a.ingest_directory(Path("/path/to/project_a_docs"), 
                              recursive=True, 
                              metadata={"project": "Project A"})
    
    project_b.ingest_directory(Path("/path/to/project_b_docs"), 
                              recursive=True, 
                              metadata={"project": "Project B"})
    
    # Query is scoped to just Project A documents
    project_a_response = project_a.query("What are the key milestones for this project?")
    
    # Query is scoped to just Project B documents
    project_b_response = project_b.query("What are the technical requirements?")
    
    # Create project-specific knowledge graphs
    project_a.create_graph("project_a_graph")
    project_b.create_graph("project_b_graph")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    from morphik import AsyncMorphik
    from pathlib import Path
    
    async with AsyncMorphik() as db:
        # Create folders for different projects
        project_a = db.create_folder("project_a")
        project_b = db.create_folder("project_b")
        
        # Ingest project documentation into respective folders
        await project_a.ingest_directory(Path("/path/to/project_a_docs"), 
                                      recursive=True, 
                                      metadata={"project": "Project A"})
        
        await project_b.ingest_directory(Path("/path/to/project_b_docs"), 
                                      recursive=True, 
                                      metadata={"project": "Project B"})
        
        # Query is scoped to just Project A documents
        project_a_response = await project_a.query("What are the key milestones for this project?")
        
        # Query is scoped to just Project B documents
        project_b_response = await project_b.query("What are the technical requirements?")
        
        # Create project-specific knowledge graphs
        await project_a.create_graph("project_a_graph")
        await project_b.create_graph("project_b_graph")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Accessing a Folder's User Scope

You can further scope operations within a folder to a specific user by using the `signin` method on the folder object:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync">
    ```python
    # Get a folder
    project_folder = db.get_folder("project_x")
    
    # Create a user scope within this folder
    user_in_project = project_folder.signin("user_123")
    
    # This document is accessible only to user_123 within project_x
    doc = user_in_project.ingest_text("User-specific project notes")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Async">
    ```python
    # Get a folder
    project_folder = db.get_folder("project_x")
    
    # Create a user scope within this folder
    user_in_project = project_folder.signin("user_123")
    
    # This document is accessible only to user_123 within project_x
    doc = await user_in_project.ingest_text("User-specific project notes")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

See [User Management](/python-sdk/users) for more details on working with user scopes.
