Morphik provides a graphical user interface so that you can interact directly with your ingested data. This includes support for ingesting documents, retrieving relevant information, chatting with your documents, and visualizing/creating knowledge graphs. In this guide, we'll walk you through how you can set up the Morphik UI and start ingesting!

## Prerequisites

### Morphik Server

Before you begin, ensure that you have the Morphik server running. You can do this by following the instructions in the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide. To verify that the Morphik server is running, check the `[api]` section in the `morphik.toml` file (found in the root of the `morphik-core` repository). If you see the server options when you open `http://<host>:<port>/docs`, then the server is live! By default, the section should look like:

```toml
[api]
host = "localhost" # Needs to be "0.0.0.0" for docker
port = 8000
reload = true
```

So, if the configuration is the same as above, we can navigate to [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs) to access the Morphik UI. Here's what it should look like:

Excuse the additional tabs on Chrome - who knew running an open-source repo full-time required so much context switching? (No seriously, I'm asking ü§£) 

In case you don't see this, and have followed all the steps in the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide, feel free to [contact us](mailto:founders@morphik.ai).

### Node and NPM

In order to launch the UI, ensure that you have `node` and `npm` installed. A good way to check this is just by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. If you don't have `node` installed, you can view installation instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## Running the UI
You're ready to launch the UI once you have the server running and `npm` installed. In a new terminal (ensure that the server is running and not stopped), navigate to the root of the `morphik-core` repository that you launched the server from. From here change directory into the `ui-component` folder:
```bash
cd ui-component
```
Now, install the required node dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```
Finally, you're ready to run the UI component:
```bash
npm run dev
```
You should see the following output (or something similar):
```bash
(base) arnav@Arnavs-MacBook-Air ui-component % npm run dev

> @morphik/ui@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

  ‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.2.26
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000

 ‚úì Starting...
 ‚úì Ready in 1560ms
```

If that's the case, you've done it! Navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000), and you should be greeted with Morphik's UI! It should look something like this:

Clicking on a file should get you some of its information on the right. 

## Using the UI - Features we ‚ù§Ô∏è

Morphik has support for **automatic metadata extraction** at file ingestion time. You can define a `json schema`, and then Morphik will automatically extract the metadata from the file:

**Chunk searching** - perfect for testing and iterating on retrieval strategies:

Visualize your **knowledge graphs** to better understand the relationships between your data:
