## Overview

Morphik provides native support for the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) - an open standard that allows AI models like Claude to directly access structured data and knowledge bases.

With Morphik's MCP integration, you can:

- Let Claude, or other MCP supported models to search through your documents based on natural language queries
- Retrieve knowledge from your Morphik database without writing complex code
- Give AI models direct access to your organization's information
- Enable more accurate, context-aware responses using your own data

## Setup

Morphik's MCP support is provided through the `@morphik/mcp` package, which acts as a bridge between Morphik and MCP-compatible AI assistants. 

### Prerequisites

- A running Morphik server (local or cloud)
- Node.js 16.0.0 or higher

## Configuration with Claude Desktop

To integrate Morphik with Claude Desktop:

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the Morphik MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "morphik": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@morphik/mcp",
        "--uri=your-morphik-server-uri"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For local Morphik server, you can either omit the `--uri` parameter or use `--uri=local`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "morphik": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@morphik/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using with Claude

Once configured:

1. Close and restart Claude Desktop.
2. Claude will now have access to the following tools:
   - `retrieve-chunks`: Search for relevant chunks from your knowledge base
   - `retrieve-docs`: Search for entire documents in your knowledge base
   - `query`: Generate a completion using relevant context
   - `list-documents`: List available documents
   - `get-document`: Get a specific document's details
   - `ingest-text`: Add new text to your knowledge base
   - `delete-document`: Remove a document from your knowledge base

## Example Interaction

Here's how a typical interaction with Claude using Morphik MCP might look: */}

{/* ```
User: /mcp morphik
Claude: I've connected to the Morphik MCP server. I can now access your documents and knowledge base. What would you like to know?

User: What documents do I have available?
Claude: [Claude uses list-documents tool to show available documents]

User: Tell me about quantum computing based on my documents
Claude: [Claude uses retrieve-chunks to find relevant information about quantum computing from your documents]
```
